# ATmegaTemp-Thermostat

Digital thermostat with programmed output to control water heating and residential central heating that is interconnected with a solar panel system.

This equipment has the following characteristics:
- Atmega 2560 microprocessor.
- Real time clock.(Optional) I've uploaded 2 programs with or without the RTC. 
-LCD 2.8‚Äù touch screen.
- Temperature sensor with waterproof cable.
- 1x Relay Output for 3-way valve control.
- Maximum and minimum temperature configuration to control the water temperature according to the desired values.
- 2x programmed outputs where days of the week and duration period (Hours and Minutes) can be selected to control these outputs.
- Graph of daily temperature records.
- Internal table of temperature records where it is possible to check 4 records per hour for 24 hours.
- Mini SD memory card to store temperature records with a recording period that can be configured with the capacity to store up to thousands of records depending on the desired size of the SD card.
- EventsDownloader vb.net application for Windows where the same records can be downloaded. (This is a separate application to download all events to the laptop)

This equipment is currently running at my Dad's home controlling his water and heating system through a 3way valve that commutes between heating hot water tank or heating the house radiators system.
